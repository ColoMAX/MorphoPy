# Summary

TODO:
- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.
- A clear Statement of Need that illustrates the research purpose of the software.

`MorphoPy` has been developed in the context of a benchmarking study for cortical interneuron cell type classification
based on their morphology [@laturnus:2019]. It was designed to facilitate and bundle the extraction of different feature
representations from neural morphologies, namely density maps, single valued morphometric statistics and persistence
diagrams as described by @kanari:2018 and @li:2017. It has already been used in a series of scientific publications that tried
to relate transcriptome, electrophysiology and morphology of cortical interneurons in V1 and M1 [@scala:2019; @scala:2020].
